Imported from Google Code 2012

Old project of mine from 2012. Here's a youtube video of someone demoing it's usage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goBtZ9tbtEo

There have been many other versions of this tool around, and none had been updated for the season two masteries, so i took it upon myself to make my own version of the tool!
